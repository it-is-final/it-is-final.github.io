title: Made a new blog
---
I have lost track of the number of attempts I have tried to start a new blog.
This is my first on Jekyll but I have tried to create other ones on different platforms but they did not stick.
I’ll list out the tools I remember trying in the past for the blog:

- Hugo
- Zola
- 11ty (never actually made it the actual GitHub Pages website)

I will likely not post here much but it is nice knowing that I can post here at any time about technical topics that I happen to find interesting enough to post at length.

Oh, and I chose Jekyll just because it feels simple, though I did do the set up inside of WSL rather than install directly on Windows just because I had a bad feeling that installing the stack on Windows would be more difficult than doing it on Linux (though it could also just be me being too worried).
In fact I set up quite a bit of stuff inside WSL so maybe it’s just natural instinct.
