Hello!

My name is Luong, but online I go by the alias *final* (and variants like *finalium* or *it-is-final*).
If you ever meet me in real life, then you can call me by my real name but in all other instances, please just call me *final*!
In the past I might be referred by other names like *kazu(marks)*, *kaitou(cr)*, and *ImmutableCabbage*.

I am currently a student in RMIT University, studying for an Associate Degree in Information Technology.
I am hoping to advance to a Bachelor of Computer Science once I completed my studies in the associate degree.
When I am not studying, I usually like doing some more coding, doing ‘glitch research’ in old Pokémon games, do some gaming, obsess about the public transportation system, and read up on whatever happens to pique my interest at that point in time.

If you want to see stuff I have made, here are a few of what I consider decent:

- [IVcalc][IVcalc]: an IV calculator I have made for the Pokémon games, all done with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript!
- [rse-text-decoder][rse-text-decoder]: a tool I have made that can decode the box names of the Pokémon storage system in the generation III games back into the bytes.

The rest can be found on my GitHub, which is linked in the footer.
